The CFD department is made up of 5 teams: The Entities & Equities and Company Financials teams provide the backbone of structured corporate data, ensuring accurate financials, consistent identifiers, and clear linkages across companies, securities, and markets. The Alternative Data & Sustainable Finance Solutions team builds on this foundation by sourcing high-value alternative datasets that generate insights and predictive analytics on individual company performance. They also develop derived analytics that assess a company’s performance on key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators, both over time and relative to peers. The Managed Investments & Benchmarks team curates comprehensive data on funds, benchmark indices, and ownership structures. This data underpins portfolio construction, benchmarking, and performance attribution, enabling investors and asset managers to measure outcomes, compare strategies and make informed investment decisions. The Macro Data & BNEF team delivers critical insights into global economic trends and the energy transition. Their work includes timely economic indicators, market signals, and forward-looking analysis that help clients understand macroeconomic dynamics and the evolving landscape of sustainable energy. What you will do: As a member of our department, you will have the opportunity to research, design and develop high quality, low latency, distributed, and scalable self-service platforms and mission-critical applications. This includes developing innovative solutions to provide automation as well as manual processing utilizing a variety of proprietary and open source technologies on microservices-based architecture with generic and extensible data models stored in big data platforms. You will work closely with Business, Data, and other Engineering teams globally in a hybrid environment on all phases of software development using Agile methodologies. You will take full ownership of products and collaborate with team members and stakeholders to shape the team's direction, culture, and vision.

Market Data is information -- trades, quotes, and other pricing data -- gathered from around the world on every possible kind of financial instrument, from stocks and bonds to currencies and commodities, and other trading venues across the globe. In the aggregate, this amounts to several hundreds of billions of events across 100 million instruments. Read our blog to know more! Our Teams Ticker Plant is organized into the following functional areas. Market Data Distribution handles the movement of real-time market data in and out of the Ticker Plant system. This group owns and develops infrastructure that carries hundreds of billions of events originating from across thousands of machines spanning hundreds of clusters with low latency. In addition to the distribution infrastructure, this group provides sharding infrastructure that enables horizontal scalability of the Ticker Plant. Database Infrastructure develops a high performance time-series database that supports low latency data storage and retrieval for high-volume applications, and stores all Market Data at Bloomberg. The storage engine hosts several petabytes of data, across hundreds of millions of instruments. The query engine handles ~100 billion queries daily ranging from interactive queries to batch queries at very high throughputs of up to 100K QPS. Data Content area focuses on APIs, systems and services which transform, enrich, store and publish these market data events, relying on externally provided middleware and persistence technology solutions. We are looking for motivated engineers in Database Infrastructure and Market Data Distribution areas to help build the next generation Ticker Plant! Our Technology Being the core of the market data infrastructure, the Ticker Plant system by necessity is scalable, distributed, highly performant, and stable. To be highly performant, most of the critical software is written in C++. Python is also extensively used to build auxiliary services around the critically important software and to enable automation. In addition, we use a wide range of engineering strategies to solve problems ranging from using off the shelf software (like kafka) to implementing our own algorithms/solutions (e.g custom built database), as appropriate for the problem at hand. What we do We have some unique challenges where we not only have to optimize for scale (billions of data points, hundreds of hosts) but also for very high throughput of updates and queries, all at the same time. As market data volume increases each year, these challenges get harder to meet with the current infrastructure and so we are re-architecting and re-writing the core parts of our system to make the system simpler and easier to scale. Some examples are: Consolidate existing data distribution mechanisms onto a fast, loss-less, resilient market data distribution infrastructure. Improve scalability of the Ticker Plant by separating data processing and data storage layers, making them independently scalable and ultimately moving storage and query layers to cloud infrastructure. Modernize data storage technologies by adopting industry best practices What is in it for you: Hands-on experience working on large scale distributed systems Join a group in the early stages of a major system re-architecture Work on core computer science problems such as efficient data storage, data discoverability, data transmission and distribution Work with high-caliber individuals and experienced teams of engineers and management Be challenged with trying to make our system more modular and horizontally scalable We’ll trust you to: Take full ownership of technical solutions/features Design, implement, and own critical applications/components of our infrastructure stack Write quality code with automated tests Collaborate with other engineers in the team and with our CTO office & business partners You’ll need to have: Experience programming in C++/Python or other object oriented languages BS, MS, PhD in Computer Science, Engineering or related technology field or relevant boot camp experience Deep desire to learn and understand software infrastructure O ur culture: We’re proud of our culture and collaboration sits at the centre of how we operate, you’ll collaborate across teams and locations on a global scale, both virtually and in person.
